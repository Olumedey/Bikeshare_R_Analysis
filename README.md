# A BIKESHARE MEMBERSHIP ANALYSIS
## BUSINESS TASK
*Cyclistic* is a Chicago-based bikeshare company with a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations. The business task for Cyclisticâ€™s bike-sharing operation is to maximize the number of annual memberships through casual-ridership conversion. This is a push from the marketing department to design an effective campaign targeting casual rider conversion.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

This analysis project is going to shed light on usage patterns for subscribed and casual riders using historical bike trip data. The analysis is intended to guide the best marketing strategy to employ based solely on ridership usage insight. A key component of this strategy is to be data-driven and allow insights from this analysis, alongside other business considerations, to the execution of an effective campaign


## DATA SOURCES
